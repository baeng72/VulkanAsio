# VulkanAsio
Asio enabled Vulkan app for guitar. WIP.<br/>
If I ever continue it, I'll have some form of layout of "pedals" shown in the order you select the effects.
This is very ugly at the moment, but the audio processing/Asio interface works, sort of. <br/>
The audio processing (fxobjects.h) code is NOT mine but Will Pirkles. <br/>
